# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Melissa (ðŸŒˆshe/her)

### It's nice to meet you!

I'm an accredited [Associate Statistician](https://ssc.ca/en/accreditation) (A. Stat.) and a Senior Data Analyst at Statistics Canada. I completed my M. Sc. in Statistics at Carleton University (2021), and my B. Sc. H. in Mathematics and Computing Systems with a Specialization in Statistics at Trent University (2019). 

I'm passionate about all things Data Science and Teaching (and especially where those two things interact!). I make [educational YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/ggnot2) in my spare time (under the name "ggnot2"), covering topics such as R programming and Machine Learning.

I'm a co-organizer for the [R-Ladies Ottawa chapter](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-ottawa/). If you're a gender minority interested in R or open source and you're in the Ottawa area, join us!

You can find me on [my website](https://www.melissavanbussel.com/) [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/ggnot2), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/melissavanbussel/), [Twitter](https://x.com/melvanbussel) and [GitHub](https://github.com/melissavanbussel).
