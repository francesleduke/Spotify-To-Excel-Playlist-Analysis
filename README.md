# Project Name
Spotify to Excel Playlist Analysis

## Description
This project extracts Spotify playlist data and outputs it into Excel, and will automatically update the spreadsheet when a new song is added. I decided to write this program because the playlist I've created for my partner is ever-growing, and I need a way to add notes and important properties of these songs into one place.
